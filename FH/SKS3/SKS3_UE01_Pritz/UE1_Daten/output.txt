Dennett, the person-to-be is the robot cog, or a descendant thereof, a being taking shape with Dennett's help at MIT.2 I have advanced a number of arguments designed to establish that the person building project" will inevitably fail, but that it will manage to produce artifacts capable of excelling in the famous Turing Test, and in its more stringent relatives.3 What sort of
artifacts will these creatures be? I over an unflattering one-word response: Pollock, Dennett, and like-minded researchers are busy building zombies. Is it really possible that what Pollock and Dennett and other computationalists are building is a creature whose overt behavior is as sophisticated as ours, but whose inner life is as empty as a rock's? I believe so. I alsobelieve for reasons to be specified below that the mere possibility of zombies is enough to explode the computational conception of mind. A recent clash between Daniel Dennett and John Searle over zombies provides a tailor-made springboard to a sustained defense of the zombie attack against computationalism. Dennett, more than any other thinker, says that no philosopher of mind has anything to fear from zombies; in fact, he thinks that those philosophers who seriously ponder zombies (and Blockheads, Twin Earthlings, and Swampmen) have lost their grip on reality". Searle, on the other hand, believes that zombies threaten at least behavioral conceptions of mentality. In this paper I try to show that Searle is right, and that
he has laid the foundation for a new, rigorous attack on computationalism the zombie attack. If this attack is sound, it will follow not only thataspiring person builders will fail, but that in failing they may indeed give us zombies.
