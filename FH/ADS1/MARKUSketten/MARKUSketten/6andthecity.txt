Year after year, 20-something
women come to New York City...

  
...in search of the two L's:

  
Labels and love.

  
- Yeah.
- It's the best.

  
Hot dress!

  
Twenty years ago, I was one of them.

  
Having gotten the knack for labels early,
I concentrated on my search for love.

  
Turns out, a knockoff is not as easy to spot
when it comes to love.

  
What? You're married?

  
You fucking asshole!
Motherfucker, you're married?

  
- Until it is.
- I fucking hate you.

  
That is why you need help to spot them.

  
Lots of help.

  
Help also known as Charlotte York...

  
...Miranda Hobbes...

  
...and Samantha Jones.

  
- Oh, my God, look at his.
Hey.

  
Hi, how are you?

  
Oh, well.

  
My name is Carrie Bradshaw,
and I'm a writer.

  
Year after year,
my single girlfriends were my salvation.

  
And as it turns out, my meal ticket.

  
I've been dating since I was 15.
I'm exhausted. Where is he?

  
Charlotte was looking
for the pertect love.

  
- Trey can't get it up.
- Well, almost perfect.

  
I'm becoming a Jew.

  
We're not barren,
we're reproductively challenged.

  
- They're giving us a baby.
- That's our baby.

  
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed
to China and back...

  
...for their daughter, Lily.

  
Miranda was a disciple of tough love.

  
Bye. Great sex.

  
- Steve, I'm pregnant.
- You're what?

  
Carrie.

  
I, Miranda Hobbes,
take you, Steve Brady...

  
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn
for Brady and Steve.

  
Who wants a Popsicle?

  
Oh, man. Boy.

  
Samantha's love was sex.

  
Lots of sex.

  
I'm dating a guy
with the funkiest-tasting spunk.

  
Can I cancel my rice pudding?

  
And then she found a man
that combined sex and love.

  
I'm gonna help you be a star.

  
Yes, he is interested...

  
So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood
with television star Smith Jerrod.

  
As for me,
I was looking for something big.

  
Get in.

  
Mr. Big. Turns out when that big
love comes along, it's not always easy.

  
Just tell me I'm the one.

  
And despite all the other chapters
of my life...

  
...no one was ever quite
big enough until...

  
Carrie, you're the one.

  
And just like that, I was.

  
Three books and three years later...

  
...we still feel like those four single girls.

  
And even though time had moved us on...

  
...I managed to stay exactly where I was:

  
In love.

  
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

  
I got a good feeling about this one, kid.

  
Oh, I hope so.
I've always loved this block.

  
Hi, 3C?

  
Finding the perfect apartment
in New York City...

  
...is like finding the perfect partner.
It can take years.

  
- So how many is this?
- Thirty-three.

  
Lucky 33.

  
- The worst. I just left you a message.
- And the kitchen's through here.

  
That's the window with the best view.

  
Thirty-four? Lucky 34?

  
Well, if anything else opens up,
let us know.

  
We're very interested in this building.

  
I do have another apartment
that's not even on the market yet.

  
Care to take a look?

  
- Sure.
- Sure.

  
All right, then.

  
It's more than you were looking to pay.

  
- How much more?
- More.

  
So this is where they keep the light.

  
Oh, my God.

  
I have died
and gone to real-estate heaven.

  
Just a simple home for two.

  
And across the rooftop terrace...

  
What, nirvana?

  
Hello. I live here.

  
Your wife has quite a sense of humor.

  
- They're not married.
- He's my boyfriend.

  
This way.

  
Aren't I a little old
to be introduced as your boyfriend?

  
Point taken. From now on,
you'll be my man-friend.

  
- That sounds like a dog.
- Well, if the shoe fits...

  
And this is the master bedroom.

  
Uh.

  
It's hideous. I hate it. Hurts my eyes.

  
- How is this place even available?
- Nasty divorce.

  
If you live here,
what is there to fight about?

  
Hm.

  
- Well, now I understand the divorce.
- I can build you a better closet.

  
Welcome home, baby.

  
Can...? Can we afford this?

  
I got it.

  
Okay, let's sign some contracts.

  
"I got it." Just like that.

  
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee.
- It sounds perfect.

  
Except for the closet,
which Big says he can redo.

  
And he says the kitchen needs work.

  
Of course, I don't know about that
because I keep sweaters in my stove.

  
So he bought it
and you'll live there with him.

  
Yes, together. That's right.

  
But he'll own it, so
you're keeping your own place, right?

  
I haven't figured out the details,
but I'm a smart girl.

  
I'll figure out something
that I'm comfortable with.

  
I just wanna be sure
that you're being smart.

  
And I love you for that.

  
But for now,
can't you stop worrying for me...

  
...and just go ahead and feel
what I want you to feel, jealous?

  
Oh, jealous of me living in this
gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan.

  
- All right, I'm jealous.
- Thanks.

  
You live in real-estate heaven
and I live in Brooklyn.

  
New York magazine said
Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.

  
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn.

  
- Hey, there she is. Hey, Hollywood.
- Hey.

  
Oh, lady. Hi.

  
- How was your flight?
- Fabulous.

  
- Oh, good.
- Good.

  
- Let's go in. I'm so excited.
Show us.

  
It was a rare occasion that brought
all types of New York women together.

  
Sorry.

  
Blair Elkenn was a waitress
turned model turned actress...

  
...turned billionaire's girlfriend
who came home one night...

  
...to find herself unceremoniously
turned out on the street.

  
Oh, my God.

  
And now she was getting
the ultimate breakup revenge:

  
An embarrassing
and very public auction...

  
...of all the jewelry he had given her
when they were happy.

  
There it is. My baby.

  
Oh, she's a beauty.

  
When I saw it in the catalog,
I said to Smith:

  
"This flower ring is the essence of me.
One of a kind, filled with fire."

  
- And a little too much.
- Exactly.

  
Let's go spend some of
my hard-earned Hollywood money.

  
And now Lot 39, the flower ring.

  
That's it.

  
We'd like to start the bidding
on this at $10,000, please.

  
At ten-thousand doll...
Thank you, madam. At 10,000.

  
Fifteen thousand. At $15,000.

  
Hey, she's bidding for somebody
on the phone.

  
That's not fair.
- Bitch.

  
The gloves are off.

  
At $30,000. Now it's against you.
Thirty-five thousand.

  
- I work hard, I deserve this.
At 40,000 now.

  
At 40? Forty thousand?
Forty thousand, thank you.

  
Forty-five thousand. At $45,000.
Now 50,000?

  
Fifty fucking thousand.

  
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand?
At $55,000 against you.

  
Would you like to say 60?
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000?

  
I draw the line at 50.

  
I thought this auction would be more fun,
but it's kind of sad.

  
Isn't it?

  
I thought it was just sad for me
because I know her.

  
But it really is sad, huh?

  
And it's funny
because they were so happy.

  
- Yeah, till they weren't.
- I know, right?

  
We all told her to get married
but she didn't wanna listen.

  
He'd been married three times before,
so she let it ride...

  
...and then she came home one night
and he had locked her out.

  
She didn't even have anywhere to live.

  
Such a shame. After 10 years.

  
She was a smart girl...

  
...till she fell in love.

  
I'm thinking...

  
...l'm going to sell my apartment...

  
...and put the money towards
heaven on 5th.

  
Why? You love your apartment.

  
I know, but there's plenty of room
in the new place and...

  
And besides, l...

  
I want to make us a life there.

  
You know, l... I want it to be ours.

  
It is ours. I bought it for us.

  
And that's so amazing,
but you bought it.

  
So really it's your place
and if anything were to happen...

  
What's going to happen?

  
Come on, I have to be smart here.
We're not married, I'd have no legal rights...

  
...you know, to...
To this home that I built...

  
...with you.

  
Did you wanna get married?

  
Well, I didn't...
I didn't think that was an option.

  
What if it was an option?

  
Why? What, do you wanna get married?

  
I wouldn't mind being married to you.

  
Would you mind being married to me?

  
No. No, not if...
Not if that's what you wanted.

  
I mean, is...? Is that what you want?

  
I want you.

  
So...

  
...okay.

  
So...?

  
- Really? We're...? We're getting married?
- We're getting married.

  
- Should we get you a diamond?
- No, no.

  
Just get me a really big closet.

  
So the other night Big and I
were talking about...

  
...you know,
moving in together and our future...

  
...and, you know, what makes sense
as we move forward and...

  
...well...

  
...we decided to get married.

  
- And I'm deaf.
- I'm so excited!

  
- Everybody is looking.
- Sorry!

  
I'm so sorry, everyone...

  
...but this is my friend
and she just got engaged.

  
And she has been going out
with the man for 10 years.

  
I'm mortified.

  
There is literally a ringing in my ear.

  
And the big news
was about to go bicoastal.

  
Samantha Jones.

  
Well, I made a little decision
I hope you'll be happy about.

  
- Oh, honey, you finally got Botox.
- No, I did not get Botox.

  
- I'm telling you, Carrie, you're gonna love it.
- I did not call...

  
...to talk about Botox.
- Well, I'm just saying.

  
So last week...

  
...after the auction,
I started thinking about my options.

  
- Right.
- And, um...

  
Well, Big and I decided to get married.

  
- Really?
- Yeah.

  
Well, that's great.

  
You sounded more excited
about the Botox.

  
Honey, I am excited for you,
but you know me.

  
I don't really believe in marriage.

  
Now, Botox, on the other hand,
that works every time.

  
Honey, l... I gotta go.

  
We can catch up
when I'm in town next week.

  
Hello.

  
I think I was in shock.

  
I mean, it's you getting married.

  
This is not some random person, it's you.

  
Yeah, I hear you.

  
I thought that after that big mess with
Aidan, you'd never wanna get married.

  
So I put you in my
"we're never getting married" file.

  
Now I'm gonna have to
take you out of that file.

  
Well, I'm sorry about
all the extra paperwork.

  
You'll get my bill.

  
Samantha, it just feels
so different this time.

  
You know, there's no clichÃ©d
romantic kneeling on one knee.

  
It's just...

  
...two grownups making a decision
about spending their lives together.

  
Well, I'm happy for you.

  
Oh, and Hey, one more thing.

  
I want you to be maid of honor.

  
- How do you feel about that?
- The same way you feel about Botox:

  
Painful and unnecessary.

  
- Seventy-four, 75, 76. Seventy-six guests.
- Seventy-five sounds better.

  
A small wedding of 75 guests.

  
Seventy-six trombones, yes.
Seventy-six guests, no.

  
As a wedding gift,
Charlotte had given me...

  
...Anthony Marantino,
friend and wedding planner.

  
All right.

  
Well, that's...

  
Cutthroat. I love it.
I hope you're this decisive...

  
...when it comes to location and the dress.
- I found the dress.

  
- What? When?
- Yeah, the other day. I have it.

  
- This is gonna be good.
- I am so excited.

  
Okay.

  
Here it is.

  
That was the exact reaction
I was aiming for.

  
It's pretty, but it's... It's so simple.
